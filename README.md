# PerformingRobots

The main character of the performance is a robot that pick up phone and answer customer service phone calls. He gets tired of answering phone call all day long and want to try something different. 

* Areas of greatest risk or uncertainty: audience interaction and robot movement
* Mechanical: the robot is able to move around on stage and pick up telephone
* Electronics: arduino yun, servomotor, 
* Software: a local network; audiences' interface; robot's movement
* Power: portable battery for arduino, 9v for motors/servos
* Parts list: arudino yun, servomotor, dc motor
* Schedule


Idea for Final Project

Me and Mateo are interested in the idea of an interative performance. Audiences can interact with the robot/images/sound on stage as a group. At the beginning of the performance, the audiences can connect their phone to the local network of Arduino and open a website, which is the interactive interface with the performance. During the performance, audiences can interact with the performance in real time. 

Based on this, we have couple ideas:
1. Audiences input sentences. Texts show on the big screen in real time along with real time computer generated images/animations. The robot's behavior becomes more and more messy to convey the state that lots of outside ideas come in that you don't know what to do.
2. Group's behavior. People can control where the robot goes. Someone may want to push the robot off the stage, while others want to save the robot. The performace can show the decision made by the group.

We need an Arduino Yun.



A Robotic Performance: https://youtu.be/O-bjTfYILPs

This is a performance showcasing a research in robotic musicianship. There are four robots and one human in the video. Three small robots move based on an analysis of the music and a big robot generates an improvisation given a precomposed chord progression using a generative algorithm that jointly optimizes for higher level musical parameters and its physical constraints.

A Robotic Performance: https://youtu.be/O-bjTfYILPs

This is a performance showcasing a research in robotic musicianship. There are four robots in the video. Three small robots move based on an analysis of the music and a big robot generates an improvisation given a precomposed chord progression using a generative algorithm that jointly optimizes for higher level musical parameters and its physical constraints.
